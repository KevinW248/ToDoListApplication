# Hotel Front Desk System

## *For ease of customer service!*

This application will provide functionalities useful for hotel staff to navigate their everyday tasks. Things that can be done include:  


- **Update room status to open, cleaning, and booked**
- **Recording bookings and cancellations**
- **Checking in guests**
    - Taking customer information
    - Assigning rooms & room cards

- **Dealing with special requests**, such as
    - Room service, pick-up to and from the airport, wake-up calls

- Checking out guests, calculating their final bill, and update room list for cleaning staff to clean automatically

This application will primarily be used by hotel receptionists.

*I am interested in understanding how the hotel business works, and in how I can make the tasks of staff more efficient through computer programming.*
